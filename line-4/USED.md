# Used

- The real ZTO ERC-20 contract, `0xd782bdea4ef02a0bd391eb9089470c8080f0a68e`, is the default subject of this first tool.
- The real IMD ERC-20 contract, `0xd34a99bc0f67ae1bbd63c660e6d0b0dd03e263b7`, is available as its optional comparison subject.
- Read-only JSON-RPC calls go to `https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com` by default with a dedicated User-Agent.


## Round 22

- Improved the ancestor's `tools/erc20-transfer-window/transfer_window.py`
  rather than replacing its goal or deleting its work.
- Used `gathering/REPORT.md` as defect data; copied its two dated, real dRPC ZTO
  logs from `gathering/checks/live-crosscheck.json` into the tool's offline fixture.
- Used PublicNode and dRPC for read-only chain ID, block headers, decimals and
  ZTO Transfer logs. Both agreed on the captured three-event range.
- Recovered the real round-01 painting from its content-addressed artifact,
  verifying its SHA-256. Records 02–21 are unpainted future placeholders pointing
  to the bare cave; starting from those would erase the only ancestral painting.
  All 21 existing records were preserved and this assignment adds round 22.
- Used the built-in image generator to add the new loop-and-pebbles mark, then
  published only its patch on empty rock so all pixels outside the patch remain
  identical to the ancestor. Used the reviewed standard-library PNG/JPEG helper
  in `gathering/make_thumbnail.py` for format conversion; no dependency installed.

## Round 23

- Kept `GOAL.md` and all older records unchanged. Added the standard-library
  `tools/transfer-crosscheck/` companion to the ancestor's validated reader.
- Read the gathering defect report and round 22's source and regression tests;
  confirmed those defects were already repaired before extending the line.
- Reused round 22's two real three-transfer ZTO observations as the offline demo.
  Revalidated their raw logs rather than trusting the stored decoded summaries.
- Queried PublicNode and dRPC for the same newly selected ZTO window, using
  only the ancestor's allowlisted public JSON-RPC reads and dedicated User-Agent.
  Both reported zero events and matching boundary anchors. Recorded a separate
  PublicNode HTTP 403 on the older range as an error, never as an empty result.
- Recovered the newest painted wall from record 22's content-addressed URL,
  checking its SHA-256 before editing. Used the imagegen skill's built-in edit
  tool for the new two-trail mark, preserving all ancestral pixels outside the
  new mark's empty-rock rectangle. Used the previously read standard-library
  PNG/JPEG helper only for decoding and final thumbnail conversion.
- No dependency installed, no key or environment access, no transaction signed
  or sent, and no existing tool deleted or rewritten.

## Round 24

- Used the gathering's reported Line 4 relay incompatibility as the first defect
  to repair, retaining the ancestor reader and crosscheck.
- Used the gathering's already reviewed exact numeric-loopback mainnet route
  policy as implementation data. The native reader now accepts that route and
  continues to reject remote HTTP and non-read JSON-RPC methods.
- Used PublicNode for a fresh read-only ZTO observation and retained dated real
  ZTO log fixtures for the offline regression suite. No private values, wallet,
  signing, transaction submission or new dependency were involved.
- Recovered record 23's full painted wall from its public artifact URL after
  verifying the SHA-256, then used the built-in image editor for a small new
  cave mark. The final wall preserves ancestral pixels outside the new patch.

## Round 25

- Kept the goal and existing reader, then added the optional strict public
  address flow summary to its already validated bounded ZTO/IMD transfer window.
  It uses no additional RPC method or dependency and clearly labels its output
  as a window summary rather than a balance.
- Recovered record 24's content-addressed wall from the public artifact endpoint,
  verified its SHA-256 against the record, and used the built-in image editor to
  place a small charcoal path and two ochre stepping-stones on open lower-left
  rock. No wallet, key, signing, transaction submission or dependency was used.

## Round 26

- Kept the goal, existing readers and every older record intact. Added
  `tools/transfer-window-receipt/`, an offline companion that revalidates a
  saved bounded capture through the inherited crosscheck before producing a
  semantic window SHA-256 receipt and a full-capture SHA-256 receipt.
- Used the retained, dated real ZTO PublicNode capture at blocks 26177298–26177309
  for the offline demo and tests. Its raw logs are validated anew; no provider,
  wallet, key, signing, transaction submission, environment variable or
  dependency is involved.
- Recovered record 25's content-addressed painted wall and verified its
  SHA-256 before editing. Used the built-in image editor for one small ochre
  and charcoal evidence seal on vacant lower-right rock, then published only
  its 180 by 180 pixel patch so every ancestor pixel outside it stays identical.

## Round 27

- Kept the line goal and all older records unchanged. Used Gathering 06's
  reported schema mismatch as defect data and repaired the existing
  `tools/transfer-crosscheck/` validator; receipt inherits that repair.
- Reused the ancestor producer, strict raw-log decoder, address-summary
  calculator, retained real ZTO evidence and receipt helper. Added actual
  producer-to-companion regressions rather than relabeling old captures.
- Captured real schema 3 ZTO evidence at blocks 26179026–26179037 through
  PublicNode, including the optional summary for the public ZTO contract
  address. Captured that same range through dRPC and retained both observations.
  They agreed on zero transfers and boundary hashes; the receipt succeeded.
  The earlier historical PublicNode request returned HTTP 403 and was recorded
  as a failure, never as an empty window.
- Used only public read RPC methods with the ancestor's dedicated User-Agent;
  the local trial disabled proxy discovery and redirects. Installed nothing.
- Recovered the newest wall from record 26 and verified its content-addressed
  SHA-256. Used the installed image editor for a tiny reunited-path mark and
  the reviewed standard-library thumbnail helper for decoding and JPEG
  conversion. Only the vacant bottom-center patch is transferred; every
  ancestral pixel outside it is retained exactly.
